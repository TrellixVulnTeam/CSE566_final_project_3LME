### PSU CSE 566 Final Project

This repository is created for PSU CSE 566 final project. 

**Title**: Assessing some recently published metagenomic profilers for viral and fungal samples

**Motivation**: Many metagenomic profiling tools (e.g. MetaBinG2, MiCoP and Metaglin) were published in recent few years. These tools claim that they are the best in specific analysis among the existing metagenomic profiling tools. Most of them were compared only for identifying bacterial community and thus might be bias against viruses and fungi. To order to better determine how to choose these tools for analyzing viral or fungal samples, it is needed to have an independent and comprehensive comparison among them.
